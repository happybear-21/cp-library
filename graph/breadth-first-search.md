# Breadth First Search

The path found by breadth first search to any node is the shortest path to that node, i.e the path that contains the smallest number of edges in unweighted graphs.

### Description

The algorithm takes as input an unweighted graph and the id of the source vertex s. The input graph can be directed or undirected, it does not matter to the algorithm.

* Create a queue q which will contain the vertices to the processed and a Boolean array used\[] which indicates for each vertex, if it has been visited or not
* Initially, push the source s to the queue and set used\[s] = true, and for all other vertices v set used\[v] = false. Then, loop until the queue is empty and in each iteration, pop a vertex from the front of the queue. Iterate through all the edges going out of this vertex and if some of these edges go to verteces that are not already visited, mark them as visited and place them in the queue

### Implementation

```cpp
vector<vector<int>> adj;  // adjacency list representation
int n; // number of nodes
int s; // source vertex

queue<int> q;
vector<bool> used(n);
vector<int> d(n), p(n);

q.push(s);
used[s] = true;
p[s] = -1;
while (!q.empty()) {
    int v = q.front();
    q.pop();
    for (int u : adj[v]) {
        if (!used[u]) {
            used[u] = true;
            q.push(u);
            d[u] = d[v] + 1;
            p[u] = v;
        }
    }
}
```

If we have to restore and display the shortest path from the source to some vertex u, it can be done in the following manner:

```cpp
if (!used[u]) {
    cout << "No path!";
} else {
    vector<int> path;
    for (int v = u; v != -1; v = p[v])
        path.push_back(v);
    reverse(path.begin(), path.end());
    cout << "Path: ";
    for (int v : path)
        cout << v << " ";
}
```

### Applications

* Find the shortest path from a source to other vertices in an unweighted graph.
* Find all connected components in the undirected graph in O(n + m) time.
  * To do this, we just run BFS from starting each vertex, except for vertices which have already been visited from previous runs.
  * Thus we perform normal BFS from each of the vertices but do not reset the array used\[] each and every time we get a new connected component and the total running time will still be O(n + m).
* Finding a solution to the problem or a game with the least number of moves, if each state of the game can be represented by a vertex of the graph and the transitions from one state to the other are edges of the graph.
* Finding the shortest path in a graph with weights 0 or 1.
  * This requires just a little modification to normal breadth first search: instead of maintaining teh array used\[]. we will now check if the distance to the vertex is shorter than current found distance, then if the current edge is of zero weight, we add it to the front of the queue else we add it to the back of the queue.
* Finding the shortest cycle in a directed unweighted graph.
  * Start a breadth-first search from each vertex. As soon as we try to go from the current vertex back to the source vertex, we have found the shortest cycle containing the source vertex. At this point we can stop the BFS, and start a new BFS from the next vertex. From all such cycles (at most one from each BFS) choose the shortest.
* Find all the edges that lie on any shortest path between a given pair of vertices â€Š(a, b).
  * To accomplish that, run two breadth first searches: one from a and one from b. Let da\[] be the array containing shortest distances obtained from the first BFS(from a) and db\[] be the array containing shortest distances obtained from the second BFS (from b). Now for each vertex it is easy to check whether it lies on any shortest path between a and b; the criterion is da\[v] + db\[v] = da\[b].
* Find the shortest walk of even length from a source vertex s to a target vertex t in an unweighted graph.
  * For this we must construct an auxiliary graph, whose vertices are the state (v, c), where v - the current node c = 0 or c = 1 - the current parity. Any edge (u, v) of the original graph in this new column will turn into two edges ((u, 0), (v, 1)) and ((u,1),(v, 0)). After that we run a BFS to find the shortest walk from the starting vertex (s, 0) to the end (t, 0).
